## Prisoner's Dilemma simulation

In this game, the 2 contestants make their choice independently: \
 either cooperate and split the coins evenly \
 or defect and steal all the coins for themselves.

If both choose to cooperate, they each get 3 coins. \
If both choose to defect, they each get 1 coin. \
If one defects and the other cooperates, then the one who defects get 5 and the other 0.

##### Conclusion
Turns out that the winning strategy in the long term relies on the following:
1. Nice (always cooperate in the first round)
2. Retaliatory (if the opponent defects, then defect back immediately)
3. Forgiving (if the opponent defects, then you should forgive that soon)
4. A little more forgiving
